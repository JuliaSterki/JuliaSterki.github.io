### Background
Laurent Ballesta is the Wildlife Photographer of the Year 57 Grand Title winner. He is a French marine scientist, underwater photographer and pioneer deep diver.
On his website he states that take all his underwater pictures, he and his friends had to spend more than 600 hours of observation and diving up to a depth of more than 200 meters.

### Layout
At the top, there is a photograph taken by Laurent Ballesta, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year. Beneath the title there are options to contact the author of the post, Alison Groom. On the right, a booking option to visit the exhibition appears. The text is structured by a number of subtitles and photographs taken by Ballesta. At the bottom is a box that says ,How you can help'. It gives information about how people can protect the oceans by eating less fish for example. At the end of the page there is a section called ,discover more' where people find links and texts about other photographers and projects.

### Filter functionality
There is no filter functionality as the webpage consists of one continous text with a few pictures in between. (The page I've chosen is probably not the best choice for this kind of excercise)

### Overall User Experience
The paragraphs of the text are short and easy to follow. The pictures help the users to get a better impression of Ballesta's work and what they might expect to see in the exhibition. Also, the font size is big enough so that it is easy to read for everybody. In my opinion, the text is rather on the long side and I would have appreciated to see Laurent Ballesta speaking in a linked video or at least seeing a picture of him. There are various instagram posts hyperlinked in the text which is good for the promotion of the photographer.
