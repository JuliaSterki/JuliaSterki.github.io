### Background
Dive beneath the waves with Wildlife Photographer of the Year 57 Grand Title winner Laurent Ballesta. In the inky darkness of the ocean, Laurent documents a trio of camouflage groupers abandoning their swirling cloud of fertilised eggs to the current off the Fakarava Atoll, French Polynesia.

### Layout
At the top, there is a photograph taken by Laurent Ballesta, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year. Beneath the title there are options to contact the author of the post, Alison Groom. On the right, a booking option to visit the exhibition appears. The text is structured by a number of subtitles and photographs taken by Ballesta. At the bottom is a box that says ,How you can help'. It gives information about how people can protect the oceans by eating less fish for example. At the end of the page there is a section called ,discover more' where people find links and texts about other photographers and projects.
